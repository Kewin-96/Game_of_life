# Program description
The simulation takes place on board divided into square cells. Cells can be "alive" or "dead"("1" or "0" - white or black). Succesive generations are moments of time. There are 2 rules of calculating next generation: <br />
* "dead" cell which has exacly 3 "alived" neighbors, becomes "alived". <br />
* "alived" cell with 2 or 3 "alived" neighbors stays "alived"; in another case cell dies. <br /> <br />
