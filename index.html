						"The
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: game of life">Game of Life</a>
						, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British
						mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning
						that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further
						input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration
						and observing how it evolves. It is Turingcomplete and can simulate a universal
						constructor or any other Turing machine." </br>

						<p>The game takes place on an infinite board divided into square cells. Cells can be "alive" or "dead"("1" or "0" - white or black).
						Succesive generations are succesive moments of time. There are 2 rules of calculating next generation: </br>
						- "dead" cell which has exacly 3 "alived" neighbors, becomes "alived".</br>
						- "alived" cell with 2 or 3 "alived" neighbors stays "alived"; in another case cell dies.</p>
